# Redirects

* There are a few domains that I no longer use that I want to redirect to
domains that I do use.

* The repository holds Nginx conf files to do those redirects. It redirects
both http and https.

* The Nginx conf files are hosted on a shared DigitalOcean droplet. Changes 
need to be deployed manually.
